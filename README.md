# Overreacted clone
⚡️ Let's clone one of the most inspiring blogs about front-end development ⚡️

Dan Abramov is co-creator of Redux and an active member of React core team. I can't think a better tribute to his open source contribution career that a clone of his personal blog, but with Vue.js 😜

## The goal

We benefit everyday from the ODS design system, its powerful but limited ecosystem where we feel comfy. But there are other tools out there we don't use, and we can't adopt it as fast as we like. We are a large team of developers and we should make smart and safe moves.

That's why I propose this small exercise, trying to keep ourselves a little bit more up to date.


## The job

* Use Vue.js through it's most used and loved SSR framework, [Nuxt](https://nuxtjs.org/docs/2.x/get-started/installation) 😻
* For the API, we'll use [@nuxt/content module](https://content.nuxtjs.org/). You can choose which file format to use, but the exercise will provide Markdown files.
* Use Typescript to type methods, computed properties, and try at leat to implement one interface, probably the post model will fit okay 👀
* Use Tailwind, and try to write the less CSS you can. Why? I don't know, it should be fun to dive in Tailwind docs, it's a really well done API for a CSS library. We can use [this handy module for Nuxt](https://tailwindcss.nuxtjs.org/).
* Of course, install Eslint and Prettier, and make these two coexist together properly 💀
